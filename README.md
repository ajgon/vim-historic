# Historic - Vim save history using git

This is a simple vim plugin that stores each save vim makes to a git repo. I wrote this because I miss the excellent local history built into Eclipse. Originally I tried [vimlocalhistory](https://github.com/hjdivad/vimlocalhistory) but we (www.clock.co.uk) are a PHP/JavaScript house and don't have Ruby on all our environments. So I have created a plugin that has as few dependencies as possible.

## Requires
* git
* bash
